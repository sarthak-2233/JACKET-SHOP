# JACKET-SHOP


// HERE I HAVE CREATED A BASIC WEBSITE USING HTML AND CSS TO CLEAR MY FUNDAMENTALS ABOUT THE BASICS OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES
// IN HTML I HAVE USED VARIOUS DIV FOR GREATER READIBILITY FOR A BEGINNER AND USED VARIOUS OTHER TAGS FOR NOT ONLY CLEARING MY BASICS BUT ALSO CREATING A DECENT NEAT READABLE FILE
// IN CSS I INSTEAD OF DIRECTING USING DIV , I HAVE USED THE CONCEPT OF GRID FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY AND MORE UNDERSTANDING OF CSS FUNDAMENTALS
// TO MOVE ONE STEP FURTHER I HAVE MADE THE WEBSITE RESPONSIVE FOR MAX-WIDTH :600px FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF WEBSITE ON PHONES
